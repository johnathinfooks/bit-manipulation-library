# Bit Manipulation Library
A simple bit manipulation library to learn how to do computation with bits. Does not contain any higher-level manipulations than comparisons or mathematics. Does not have any external dependancies. Many aspects of the functionality of the library may seem redundant or seem to have circular definitions, however, this is simply for learning the bare fundamentals of bitwise logic in computers.
## Restrictions
- No external library access within library functions
- No complex bit manipulation operations; only mathematical operations
- Managing a stream of bits; stream array input stream array output ordered properly
## Features
### Translations
- Integer to binary
### Bitwise Operations
- Shift left/right
- Flip bits / NOT
- AND
- OR
### Mathematics
- Addition
## Return Values
Functions return 0 upon success. Functions return -1 upon input/output size correlation failure. Functions return 1 upon error.
